Task: Build a Quiz Builder with Streamlit and LangChain

Overview:
In this task, you will leverage your skills acquired from previous tasks to create a "Quiz Builder" application utilizing Streamlit. This interactive application enables users to upload documents, designate a quiz topic, select a number of questions, and subsequently generate a quiz based on the uploaded document contents.

Components to Integrate:
- DocumentProcessor: A class developed in Task 3 for processing uploaded PDF documents.
- EmbeddingClient: A class from Task 4 dedicated to embedding queries.
- ChromaCollectionCreator: A class from Task 5 responsible for creating a Chroma collection derived from the processed documents.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Begin by initializing an instance of the `DocumentProcessor` and invoke the `ingest_documents()` method to process the uploaded PDF documents.

2. Configure and initialize the `EmbeddingClient` with the specified model, project, and location details as provided in the `embed_config`.

3. Instantiate the `ChromaCollectionCreator` using the previously initialized `DocumentProcessor` and `EmbeddingClient`.

4. Utilize Streamlit to construct a form. This form should prompt users to input the quiz's topic and select the desired number of questions via a slider component.

5. Following the form submission, employ the `ChromaCollectionCreator` to forge a Chroma collection from the documents processed earlier.

6. Enable users to input a query pertinent to the quiz topic. Utilize the generated Chroma collection to extract relevant information corresponding to the query, which aids in quiz question generation.

Implementation Guidance:
- Deploy Streamlit's widgets such as `st.header`, `st.subheader`, `st.text_input`, and `st.slider` to craft an engaging form. This form should accurately capture the user's inputs for both the quiz topic and the number of questions desired.

- Post form submission, verify that the documents have been processed and that a Chroma collection has been successfully created. The build-in methods will communicate the outcome of these operations to the user through appropriate feedback.

- Lastly, introduce a query input field post-Chroma collection creation. This field will gather user queries for generating quiz questions, showcasing the utility of the Chroma collection in sourcing information relevant to the quiz topic.
